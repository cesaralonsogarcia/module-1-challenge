# Module 1 Challenge
# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

This in an on-the-job ticket, so the starter code was provided. The objective of this challenge is to understand the importance of accessibility in web development. 

Web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Accessible sites are better positions in search engines.

## User Story

AS A marketing agency  
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards  
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards  
WHEN I view the source code  
THEN I find semantic HTML elements  
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements  
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical   structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements  
THEN I find accessible alt attributes  
WHEN I view the heading attributes  
THEN they fall in sequential order  
WHEN I view the title element  
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
